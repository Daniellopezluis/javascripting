# First assignment

1. Create a simple html template, you will be using this a lot, so either make sure your editor can create boiler plate html or have a copy at hand.
2. Create a simple page that shows an alert when loaded (`alert` is of help).
3. Create a page with an input and a button. When the button is clicked, an alert with the text in the input is shown.
4. Create a textarea and `console.log` the number of characters each time a button is clicked.
5. Repeat 3 and 4 as the user types, reporting the output to the html itself.

This will get you up and running with:
* Basic html structure.
* Selectors.
* Events.
* Basic DOM manipulation.
